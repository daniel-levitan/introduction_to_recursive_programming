# introduction_to_recursive_programming

This repo stores the files for the solutions to the exercises of the book Introduction to Recursive Programming from Manuel Rubio-Sanchez.

The exercises were not reviewed either by a professor or checked against a manual, so there may be errors in those files, but, in general, the files solve the problems proposed.

Let me know if you find anything that should be changed.
